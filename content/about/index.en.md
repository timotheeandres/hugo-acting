# About me

{{< figure src="me.jpg" alt="Picture of Timothée Andres" class="right" width="80%" >}}

I am Timothée ANDRES, a {{< age year=1996 >}} years old actor in formation based in the region of Lausanne, Switzerland.
I started off as a computer scientist, but I have been wanting for a while to explore a domain that always attracted me: voice acting.

I studied computer science at EPFL in Switzerland, but I have also been working with [JingleJungle](https://www.jinglejungle.ch/en/) since I was a child as a voice for various radio and television ads. As the years went by, I started considering a career in voice acting, but I decided to finish my studies first.
In 2020, I met the amazing Ian Stuart Hanlin, who I chatted with for a few minutes. He encouraged me to pursue that career if I so wanted. The same happened a few years later with Ellen Ray Hennessy, whose incredibly kind words finished convincing me to give it a try.

A while after I finished my Master's thesis, a friend of mine told me about Acting Line Studio. I decided that this would be my first proper education in acting (see more [here](/education)).

My long-term goal is to work as a voice actor in the animation industry: I would love to voice characters in animated movies, video games and the likes. I am especially impressed by the power of japanese voice actors.
