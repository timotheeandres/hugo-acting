This year's theme was "*J'me voyais déjà...*", which can be translated as "I could already see myself...".
This is a reference to a song by Charles Aznavour, "Je m'voyais déjà".

Our number was an interpretation of *Every Breath You Take*, by The Police, with Simran, Michael De Franceschi and Roisin Everts.

The scene depicts a young woman alone in a bar, and a trio of friends in the corner. As the woman goes to order another glass at the bar, one of the three gets up and starts singing. He already sees himself with her, and already wants to control her. He even goes as far as puppeting her, and talking through her. The two other friends join the song.
