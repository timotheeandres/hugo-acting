## Acting Line Studio (2024–Today)

{{< figure src="acting_line_studio_logo.png" class="right" alt="Acting Line Studio logo" width="200" height="200" >}}

[Acting Line Studio](https://actinglinestudio.com/) is an acting school founded by Ludovic Gossiaux in 2017. With studios in Lausanne and Geneva, this young acting school is the perfect place to take the stage for the first time while surrounded by great coaches.

I am currently studying in Acting Line in a 3-years program to learn how to "tune my instrument", as Mr.&nbsp;Gossiaux puts it: what do I feel inside that correspond to what I display, and vice-versa? How do I learn to play of that instrument to compose the melody I want?

Through this school, I also have the opportunity to participate in workshops and masterclasses lead by great people of the acting world.

### First year (2024–2025)

Thrice per week, for a total of 9 hours, I take night classes in Lausanne to discover and improve my craft: 6 hours are dedicated to the base formation, and 3 hours to an option called *"Acting in English"*.

#### Coaches

- Andrew Gordon
- Marie Ruchat
- Olga G. Andreichikova

#### Workshops and modules

- *"De la voix chantée à la voix parlée"*, a singing module presented by Cécile Bonardi, 3 times 12 hours in 2024–2025
- *"Focus self-tape"*, a module teaching about self-tapes and presentations by Frédérique Amand, 14 hours in 2025
- Singing workshop with Cécile Bonardi, 15 hours in 2025
