# Welcome to my website!

I am Timoth√©e ANDRES, a {{< age year=1996 >}} years old actor active in the region of Lausanne, Switzerland.
I started off as a computer scientist, but I have been wanting for a while to explore a domain that always attracted me: voice acting.

I have been working with [JingleJungle](https://www.jinglejungle.ch/en/) since I was a child as a voice for various radio and television ads. As the years went by, I started considering a career in voice acting, but I decided to finish my studies first.

My long-term goal is to work as a voice actor in the animation industry: I would love to voice characters in animated movies, video games and the likes. I am especially impressed by the power of japanese voice actors.
