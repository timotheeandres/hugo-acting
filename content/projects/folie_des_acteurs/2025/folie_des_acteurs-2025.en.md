This year's theme was "*J'me voyais déjà...*", which can be translated as "I could already see myself...".
This is a reference to a song by Charles Aznavour, "Je m'voyais déjà".

Our number was an interpretation of Every Breath You Take, by The Police, with Simran, Michael De Franceschi and Roisin Everts.

The scene depicts a young woman alone in a bar, and a trio of friends in the corner. As the woman goes to order another glass at the bar, the character I interpret gets up and starts singing. He already sees himself with her, and already wants to control her. He even goes as far as puppeting her, and talking through her.
In the end, we realise everything happened in their minds: the woman felt a maliscious gaze but could not determine wherefrom, and the man follows her as she leaves the stage, followed by his friends.
